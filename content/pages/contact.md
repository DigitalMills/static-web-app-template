# Tell us about your rollout

Drop a note with the type of customers you serve, the number of sites you expect to launch, and any compliance requirements. We’ll tailor the automation runbook to your stack.

- Want to accept content updates by email? We’ll wire an Azure Function to transform and commit them.
- Need approval workflows? Add branch protections so Decap CMS uses pull requests instead of direct commits.
- Planning on reselling? We can show you how to white-label the admin UI and automate invoicing.

Once the form is enabled, requests will post to your chosen endpoint as JSON. Expect fields for `name`, `company`, `email`, and `message`.
